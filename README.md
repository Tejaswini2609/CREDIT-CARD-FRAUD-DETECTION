# CREDIT-CARD-FRAUD-DETECTION
"A machine learning project for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using Logistic Regression, SVC, Decision Trees, KNN, and Random Forest, with a focus on handling class imbalance and optimizing precision and recall."

📋 Task Objectives
**This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning classification techniques.
The main goals are:
->Handle imbalanced datasets effectively.
->Train multiple classification models and compare their performance.
->Evaluate models using key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
->Help improve early fraud detection to minimize financial loss.

🛠️ How to Run This Project
1.Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/https://github.com/Tejaswini2609/.git
cd your-repo-name
2.Install required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3.Launch the notebook:
jupyter notebook CREDIT_CARD.ipynb
4.Run the notebook cells step-by-step to train and evaluate models.


🚀 Machine Learning Models Used
The following classification algorithms were applied:
->Logistic Regression
->Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
->Decision Tree Classifier
->K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
->Random Forest Classifier

Each model was evaluated based on:
->Accuracy Score
->Precision Score
->Recall Score
->Confusion Matrix

📈 Technologies Used
->Python 3.x
->Jupyter Notebook
->Pandas
->NumPy
->Matplotlib
->Seaborn
->Scikit-learn

📢 Notes
->Dataset used contains highly imbalanced classes (fraud vs non-fraud transactions).
->StandardScaler is used to normalize the features.
->Model evaluation focuses not just on accuracy, but also precision and recall due to class imbalance.
->Random Forest and Decision Trees generally show stronger performance on imbalanced datasets.
